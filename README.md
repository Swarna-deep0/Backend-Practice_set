# Java Practice â€“ Stream API & OOP Concepts

This repository contains my practice problems and solutions in Java, focusing on two important areas of backend development:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)
- Java Stream API

---

## ðŸŽ¯ My Goal
The purpose of this repository is to:
- Strengthen my problem-solving skills in Java  
- Write clean, modern, and efficient Java code  
- Build a solid foundation in backend development  
- Prepare for internships, jobs, and technical interviews  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Topics Covered

### OOP Concepts
- Classes and Objects  
- Inheritance  
- Polymorphism (compile-time and runtime)  
- Abstraction  
- Encapsulation  
- Interfaces and Abstract Classes  
- Method Overloading and Overriding  
- Access Modifiers  
- Constructors and Static Members  

### Java Stream API
- Creating Streams (Collections, Arrays, primitives)  
- Intermediate Operations: `map`, `filter`, `sorted`, `distinct`, `flatMap`  
- Terminal Operations: `collect`, `reduce`, `forEach`, `count`, `min`, `max`  
- Collectors: `toList`, `toSet`, `toMap`, grouping, partitioning  
- Parallel Streams  
- Writing clean and efficient code with Streams
